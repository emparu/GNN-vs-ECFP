This is my final project for the course "Machine Learning on Graphs" (Aprendizaje Automatico en Grafos)

It consists on comparing the results on molecular property prediction of: 

--GNN (Graph Neural Networks)

--And ECFP (Extended Connectivity Fingerprint) which is a hash based feature extraction algorithm for small molecules, combined with LightGBM (Gradient Boosting)
